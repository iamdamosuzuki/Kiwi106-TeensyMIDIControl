# A MIDI Controller for a Kiwi-106 build using a Teensy 3.2

This repository contains the code and build instructions for a MIDI controller that controlls a Kiwi-106. The purpose of this controller is to have all critical Kiwi-106 controls available on a hardware interface. This can control most of the MIDI-only controls for a Kiwi-106 (all the ones I decided were necessary for performance), along with the general controls for LFO2 and ENV2. This way, the user rarely needs to enter different pages, reducing the need for menu diving. 

This code is based on:  MIDI CONTROLLER  by Notes and Volts  www.notesandvolts.com. Big thanks to Notes and Volts!

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to install the Teensy board info in the Arduino IDE: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html

## Parts List

- 1 Project Enclosure
- Teensy 3.2
- 15x Linear 10kohm pots 
- 1x Linear 10kohm deteneted pot
- 4 Toggle switches
- 13 LEDs

## Knob, Switch, and LED Description

### Pots

    - Pot 01: Channel 105: Detune Amount  
    - Pot 02: Channel 11:  PWM Source Select
        * LEDs 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    - Pot 03: Channel 15: DCO ENV Source Select
        * LEDs 10, 11
    - Pot 04: Channel 14: DCO ENV Amount
    - Pot 05: Channel 48: VCF ENV Source Select
        * LED 24, 25
    - Pot 06: Channel 59: VCA LFO Amount
    - Pot 07: Channel 61:  VCA ENV Mode
        * LEDs 27, 28
    - Pot 08: Channel 72: Int Clock
    - Pot 09: SysEx: Arp Subdivide and Seq Subdivide // Set CC to 0, which flips it to SysEx mode
    - Pot 10: Channel 22: LFO 2 Rate
    - Pot 11: Channel 23: LFO 2 Delay
        * Note: for some reason these CC values are backwards, so wrired up knob. in reverse
    - Pot 12: Channel 65: ENV 2 Attack
    - Pot 13: Channel 66: ENV 2 Decay
    - Pot 14: Channel 67: ENV 2 Sustain
    - Pot 15: Channel 68: ENV 2 Release 
    - Pot 16: MIDI Channel Select
        * Note: Muist use 11 point detented pot
        
### Toggles

    - Toggle 01: Channel 106: Detune Mode
        * Up = Mono/Unison/Poly
        * Down = Mono/Unison
    - Toggle 02: Channel 13: DCO LFO Source
        * Up = LFO 2
        * Down = LFO 1
    - Toggle 02: Channel 46: VCF LFO Source
        * Up = LFO 2
        * Down = LFO 1
    - Toggle 02: Channel 60: VCA LFO Source
        * Up = LFO 2
        * Down = LFO 1


### LEDs
Note: LED Numbers refer to the Teensy's Digital Pins

     - PWM Source Select
        * LED 0: Manual
        * LED 5: Inverted
        * LED 6: LFO 1
        * LED 7: LFO 2
        * LED 8: ENV 1
        * LED 9: ENV 2
        * LED 6: LFO 1
        * LED 7: LFO 2
        
    - DCO ENV Source Select
        * LED 10: Off = ENV 1, On = ENV 2 
        * LED 11: Off = Normal, On = Inverted
       
    - DCO ENV Source Select
        * LED 24: Off = ENV 1, On = ENV 2 
        * LED 25: Off = Normal, On = Inverted
      
    - VCA ENV Mode
        * LED 27: Off + LED 28: Off = Gate
        * LED 27: On + LED 28: Off = ENV 1
        * LED 27: Off + LED 28: On = ENV 2
        
        
### Known Bugs

    - LFO 2 Delay rate is backwards. Rather than adjusting the code I just flipped the polarity of the pot physically by switching hte Ground and +5v pins.  
    - DCO Envelope Select knob is broken. It only lets you choose between ENV 1 Normal, and ENV 2 Inverted. Not sure why, I think it's a KIWI issue.
